            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Abſtract of the bloody Maſſacre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the Inſtigation of the Jeſuits, Prieſts and Friars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHen their Plots were ripe for Execution, we find their firſt Proceedings againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> various; ſome of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> only ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and expelling them; others murthering Men, Women and Children without Mercy; all reſolving univerſally to root out all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Proteſtants</hi> out of <hi>Ireland;</hi> ſo deeply malicious were they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants,</hi> that they would not ſo much as endure the ſound of their Language.</p>
            <p>The Prieſts gave the Sacrament unto divers of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> upon condition they ſhould neither ſpare Man, Woman, nor Child of the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> One <hi>Halligan</hi> a Prieſt, read an Excommunication againſt all thoſe, that from henceforth ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or harbour any <hi>Engliſh, Scotiſh</hi> or <hi>Welch</hi>-man, or give them Alms, whereby many were famiſhed to death. The Friars exhorted them with Tears, not to ſpare any of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> they boaſted, that when they had deſtroyed them in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they would go over into <hi>England,</hi> and not leave the Memorial of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man under Heaven.</p>
            <p>They openly profeſſed, that they held it as lawful to kill a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> as to kill a Dog. One of their Prieſts ſaid, <hi>That it was no more pity to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:179313:4"/>take their Lives from them, then it is to take a Bone out of a dogs Mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Day before this Maſſacre began; the Prieſts gave the People a Diſmiſs at Maſs with liberty to go out, and take Poſſeſſion of all their Lands, as alſo to ſtrip, rob and deſpoil them of all their Goods and Cattle; the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> being, as they told them, worſe then Dogs, for they were Devils, and therefore the Killing of ſuch was a <hi>Meritorious Act,</hi> and <hi>a rare Preſervative againſt the Pains of Purgatory;</hi> and this cauſeth ſome of theſe Murtherers to boaſt, after they had ſlain many of the <hi>Engliſh, that they knew, that if they ſhould die preſently, they ſhould go ſtraight to Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh,</hi> when the Maſſacre began, perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many of their <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Neighbours to bring their Goods to them, and they would ſecure them, and hereby they got abundance peaceably into their Hands, whereof they cheated the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> refuſing to reſtore them again; yet ſo confident were the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> at firſt of them, that they gave them Inventories of all they had, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged up their beſt things that were hidden in the Ground, and depoſited them into their Cuſtody. They alſo got much into their Hands by fair Promiſes, deep Oaths and Engagements, that if they would deliver them their Goods, they would ſuffer them, with their Wives and Children, quietly to depart the Countrey; and when they had got what they could, they afterwards mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered them.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſeized upon their Goods and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ranſackt their Houſes, got their Perſons, ſtript

One Mr. <hi>Watſon</hi> they reaſted alive. A <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Woman great with Child, they ript up her Belly, cut the Child out of her Womb, and ſo left it crawling on her Body.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Starkey,</hi> Schoolmaſter at <hi>Ardmagh,</hi> being above one hundred years old, they ſtript him naked, then took his two daughters, being Virgins, whom they alſo ſtript naked, and then forced

            <p>To one <hi>Henry Cowel</hi> a gallant Gentleman, they proffered his life, if he would marry one of their Trully; or go to Maſs; but he choſe death rather then to conſent to either.</p>
            <p>Many of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> they buried alive, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing themſelves, whilſt they were digging down old ditches upon them.</p>
            <p>They brake the back bone of a Youth, and left him in the Fields; ſome days after he was found, having eaten the graſs round about him: neither then would they kill him out-right, but removed him to better Paſture, wherein was fulfilled that ſaying, <hi>The tender mercies of the wicked are cruelty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the County of <hi>Antrim,</hi> they murthered nine hundred fifty four <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in one Morning: and afterwards about twelve hundred more in that County near <hi>Liſnegarvy,</hi> they forced twenty four <hi>Proteſtants</hi> into a Houſe, and burnt them all.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Philem O Neal</hi> boaſted, that he had ſlain above ſix hundred at <hi>Garvah,</hi> and that he had left neither Man, Woman nor Child alive in the <hi>Barony</hi> of <hi>Munterlong.</hi> In other places he murthered above two thouſand Perſons in their houſes, ſo that many houſes were filled with dead bodies.</p>
            <p>Above twelve thouſand were ſlain in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, as they fled towards <hi>Down.</hi> Many died of Famine, many died for want of Cloaths being ſtript naked in a cold ſeaſon; ſome thouſands were drowned, ſo that in the Province of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> there were about one hundred and fifty thouſand

            <p>
               <hi>Ann Kinnard</hi> teſtified, That fifteen <hi>Proteſtants</hi> being Impriſoned, and their Feet in the Stocks, a <hi>Popiſh</hi> boy being not above fourteen years old, ſlew them all in one night with his Skein.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman, who was newly delivered of two Children, ſome of theſe Villains violently compelled her, in her great pain and ſickneſs, to riſe out of her Bed, and took one of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants that was living and daſhed his Brains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Stones, and then threw him into the River of <hi>Barrow;</hi> The like they did by many other Infants.

            <p>The Lord <hi>Mont Garret,</hi> cauſed divers <hi>Engliſh</hi> Souldiers, that he had taken about <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> to be hanged, hardly ſuffering them to pray before their death.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Fitz Patrick,</hi> an <hi>Iriſh Papiſt,</hi> enticed a rich Merchant that was a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> to bring all his Goods to his houſe, promiſing ſafely to keep them, and to re-deliver them to him; but when he had gotten them into his poſſeſſion, he took the Merchant and his Wife and hanged them both, The like they did by divers others. Some <hi>Engliſh</hi> mens heads they cut off, and carried them to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and on the Market-day ſet them on the Croſs; where many, eſpecially the Women

            <p>A poor <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Woman with her two Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, going to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> theſe bloody miſcreants baited them with dogs, ſtabbed them with ſkeins, and pulled out the Guts of one of the Children, whereby they died; and not far off they took divers Men, Women, and Children, and hanged them up; one of the Women being great with Child, they ripped up her Belly as ſhe hanged, ſo that the Child fell out in the Cawl alive. Some after they were hanged, they drew up and down till their bowels were torn out.</p>
            <p>How many thouſands of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were thus inhumanely butchered by ſundry kinds of deaths, we cannot aſcertain.</p>
            <p>In the Province of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> we find about 150000. murthered, as before; what the number of the ſlain was in the three other Provinces, I find not upon Record, but certainly it was very great, for you have theſe paſſages in a general Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, of the diſtreſſed <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Munſter, We may</hi> (ſay they) <hi>compare our woe to the ſaddeſt Parallel of any Story, Our Churches are prophanded by Sacrifices to Idols; Our Habitations are become ruinous heaps; No quality Age or Sex, priviledged from Maſſacre, and ling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring deaths, by being robbed, ſtript naked, and ſo expoſed to cold and famine, The famiſhed Infants of murthered Parents ſwarm in our Streets, and for want of food, periſh before our faces</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And all this cruelty that is exerciſed upon us, we know not for what cauſe, offence, or ſeeming provocation it is inflicted on us, (ſin excepted) ſaving that we were</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>&amp;c.
